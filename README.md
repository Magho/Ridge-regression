## Poject Description 
Ridge Regression (gradient descent)

## Goals
- Convert an SFrame into a Numpy array.
- Write a Numpy function to compute the derivative of the regression weights with respect to a single feature.
- Write gradient descent function to compute the regression weights given an initial weight vector, step size, tolerance, and L2 penalty.
